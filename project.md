Project: West of Haunted House 
Category: Resurrection

The Pitch: We didn't just bring the 1977 text adventure Zork back to life—we performed a séance on it.

Using Kiro, we resurrected the logic of the original "dead" source code and transplanted it into a modern Python architecture. But a true resurrection requires a soul: we used Kiro's vibe coding to "possess" the game world, rewriting the iconic sunny fields and white houses into a grim, Halloween-themed nightmare.

The result is a modern React web app presented as an animated, 3D grimoire (spellbook). The player types commands, and the "haunted" logic responds with a spooktacular twist on the classic adventure. It’s 80s logic, 2025 tech, and 100% undead.
