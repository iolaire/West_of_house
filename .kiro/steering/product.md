# Product Overview

## West of Haunted House

A modern resurrection of the 1977 text adventure Zork I with Halloween-themed transformations. The project "performs a séance" on the original dead source code, transplanting classic Zork logic into a modern Python serverless architecture while rewriting the sunny fields and white houses into a grim, Halloween nightmare.

## Core Experience

Players interact with a React web app presented as an animated 3D grimoire (spellbook). They type text commands to navigate a haunted world, solve puzzles, collect cursed treasures, and manage their sanity as they explore 110 rooms of supernatural horror.

## Key Features

- **Classic Zork Mechanics**: 110 rooms, 122 objects, treasure collection, puzzle-solving
- **Halloween Transformation**: Every room, object, and interaction rewritten with spooky descriptions
- **Sanity System**: Mental health meter (0-100) that affects descriptions and gameplay
- **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda + DynamoDB backend, React frontend on Amplify
- **Cost-Optimized**: Designed to run under $5/month for typical usage

## MVP Scope

The initial release focuses on:
- Room navigation with spooky descriptions
- Object interaction (examine, take, drop, use)
- Inventory management
- Sanity system affecting descriptions
- Basic flag-based puzzles
- Light system (lamp battery management)
- Container objects
- Treasure collection and scoring
- RESTful API for React frontend

Deferred to future phases: Combat, NPCs, curse system, blood moon cycles, soul collection, save/load.

## Target Audience

Retro gaming enthusiasts, text adventure fans, and developers interested in seeing classic game logic resurrected with modern tech and a horror twist.
