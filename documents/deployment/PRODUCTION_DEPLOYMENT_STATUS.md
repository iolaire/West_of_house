- ✅ DynamoDB table with TTL
- ✅ API Gateway with CORS
- ✅ CloudFront CDN with caching headers

## Monitoring the Deployment

### 1. AWS Amplify Console
Visit the AWS Amplify Console to monitor the build pipeline:
- Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
- Select your app: `west-of-haunted-house`
- View the `production` branch deployment

### 2. Deployment Phases
The deployment will go through these phases:

**Backend Phase** (~5-8 minutes):
- ✓ Provision resources
- ✓ Build backend (TypeScript → CloudFormation)
- ✓ Deploy Lambda functions
- ✓ Create/update DynamoDB table
- ✓ Configure API Gateway

**Frontend Phase** (~3-5 minutes):
- ✓ Install dependencies (npm ci)
- ✓ Build React app (npm run build)
- ✓ Upload to S3
- ✓ Invalidate CloudFront cache
- ✓ Deploy static assets

**Total Time**: ~8-13 minutes

### 3. Check Deployment Status

```bash
# View recent commits
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate -5

# Check if deployment is complete (look for green checkmark in Amplify Console)
# Or use AWS CLI:
aws amplify list-jobs --app-id <your-app-id> --branch-name production --max-results 1
```

### 4. Verify Deployment Success

Once deployment completes, verify the application:

**A. Check the Live URL**
- Your app will be available at: `https://<branch>.<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`
- Or your custom domain if configured

**B. Test Core Functionality**
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Verify the grimoire interface loads
3. Type a command (e.g., "look")
4. Verify room image displays
5. Check that commands are processed
6. Verify session persistence (refresh page)

**C. Check Backend API**
```bash
# Test the API endpoint directly
curl -X POST https://<your-api-endpoint>/game \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "look"}'
```

### 5. Monitor CloudWatch Logs

Check Lambda function logs for any errors:
```bash
# View recent logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/<function-name> --follow

# Or use the AWS Console:
# CloudWatch → Log groups → /aws/lambda/<function-name>
```

### 6. Monitor CloudWatch Metrics

Key metrics to watch:
- **Lambda Invocations**: Should increase as users play
- **Lambda Errors**: Should be 0 or very low
- **Lambda Duration**: Should be <500ms
- **DynamoDB Read/Write Units**: Should be minimal (on-demand)
- **API Gateway 4xx/5xx Errors**: Should be minimal

### 7. Cost Monitoring

Set up AWS Budgets to track costs:
```bash
# Create a budget alert
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id <your-account-id> \
  --budget file://budget.json
```

Expected costs:
- **Backend**: ~$0.50/month (1000 games)
- **Frontend**: ~$2.80/month (1000 games)
- **Total**: ~$3.30/month

With optimizations (lazy loading, caching, WebP):
- **Optimized Total**: ~$1.23/month

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Go to Amplify Console → Build logs
   - Look for error messages in red

2. **Common Issues**
   - **Node version mismatch**: Check `.nvmrc` file (should be 24)
   - **Missing dependencies**: Check `package.json` and `amplify/package.json`
   - **TypeScript errors**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` locally
   - **Environment variables**: Check `.env.production` file

3. **Rollback if Needed**
   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin production
   ```

### If Application Doesn't Load

1. **Check CloudFront Distribution**
   - Verify distribution is deployed
   - Check origin settings

2. **Check S3 Bucket**
   - Verify files were uploaded
   - Check bucket permissions

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests

### If API Calls Fail

1. **Check API Gateway**
   - Verify endpoint is deployed
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Test with curl or Postman

2. **Check Lambda Function**
   - Verify function is deployed
   - Check CloudWatch logs for errors
   - Test function directly in AWS Console

3. **Check DynamoDB Table**
   - Verify table exists
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Verify TTL is configured

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the Live Application**
   - Play through several game scenarios
   - Test on different devices/browsers
   - Verify all features work as expected

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check CloudWatch metrics daily for first week
   - Look for any error patterns
   - Monitor costs in AWS Cost Explorer

3. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Create CloudWatch alarms for errors
   - Set up budget alerts
   - Configure SNS notifications

4. **Document the Deployment**
   - Note the live URL
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Update README with deployment info

5. **Share with Users**
   - Announce the launch
   - Gather feedback
   - Monitor user behavior
